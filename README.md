## Project Summary 

We wanted to develop an app that would help students report emergencies, see schedules, grades, and create events in their schools. We aim to promote autonomy and responsibility by giving students the ability to feel invested in their own space and community. In a time where school shootings and violence are at an all-time-high, we believe an app such as CheckedIn is a necessity for schools of all kinds. 

## Stories

- Users can login and signup to our app
- There are 3 tiers of users: Students, Teachers, and Admins
- Students can view their schedules, grades, and events in their given school
- Students can also submit emergencies (i.e. armed student, or a student has fainted)
- Teachers can submit grades and create schedules for students
- Admins can manage the status of our users
